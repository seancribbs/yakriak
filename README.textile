h1. yakriak

A simple web-based chatroom app.  Designed as a proof-of-concept for Ben Black's Riak training at VelocityConf 2010.

h2. Features / Problems

* Everything is stored and served out of Riak. No special abstraction. Take that, couchapps!
* Browser Compatibility:
** WebKit-based (Chrome, Safari)
** Firefox 3.6 and 4.0
** MSIE8, maybe 7 (tested via 8's IE7 mode)
* Remembers your login credentials via unencrypted cookies (not transmitted).
* Randomizes the polling interval to avoid thundering-herd effects.
* Uses full-bucket map-reduce, so won't perform well at huge numbers of messages. Future work could change to use key-filters but would still incur the price of list-keys.
* Your email address will be used for Gravatar, should you decide not to remain anonymous.

h2. Setup

# Startup Riak locally on the standard HTTP port (8098).
# Join your local node to the cluster, if necessary.
# Run the @load.sh@ bash script.
# Visit "http://127.0.0.1:8098/riak/yak/index.html":http://127.0.0.1:8098/riak/yak/index.html
